# Ngwuta Desmond Chidiebere — @DLXXVII

🚀 **Mobile Developer | Flutter & Android Specialist | Learning iOS**

I'm a mobile developer with 4+ years of experience building **scalable**, **maintainable**, and **performance-driven** apps using Flutter, Kotlin, and Java. I’m currently working full-time at [NUBiA Mega Tech](https://nubiatech.co/) and also freelance with startups and solo founders to bring ideas to life—fast.

I specialize in **Flutter** and **native Android**, and I'm currently expanding my skillset into **iOS development with Swift**, UIKit, and SwiftUI to become a well-rounded cross-platform engineer.
